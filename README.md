# DSA-demo

This repository is a collection of demo code and practical examples for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) class in NCNU. All projects are implemented in C++ using the Qt framework, and are designed to illustrate essential DSA concepts through interactive or visual applications.

## Repository Structure

The codebase is organized into four main directories, each containing subfolders for specific algorithmic topics and data structures:

### Demo1: Sorting Algorithms & Fractal
- **bubble_sort**: Demonstrations of the bubble sort algorithm.
- **counting_sort**: Examples of counting sort.
- **insertion_sort**: Insertion sort algorithm demos.
- **koch_curve**: Visualization of the Koch curve (fractal).
- **quick_sort**: Quick sort implementations.

### Demo2: Trees & Binary Structures
- **AVL_Tree**: Self-balancing AVL tree operations and visualizations.
- **Binary_Search_Tree**: Binary search tree demos.
- **Binary_Tree_Traversal**: Illustrations of tree traversal methods.
- **DeleteNdoe**: (Likely) demos of node deletion in trees.
- **NewRebuild_Tree**: Advanced or alternative tree rebuilding techniques.
- **Search_node**: Node search operations in trees.
- **common_rebuild_tree**: Standard tree reconstruction methods.
- **plus**: Additional binary tree operations or examples.

### Demo3: Dynamic Programming
- **knapsack_problem2_2**: Demo and visualization for the knapsack problem, a classic DP example.
- **matrix_chain_production**: Matrix chain multiplication optimization using dynamic programming.

### Demo4: Graph Algorithms & Miscellaneous
- **Alarm_Clock.cpp**: A standalone C++ program—possibly an algorithmic simulation or utility.
- **a.exe**: Compiled executable of one of the demos (Windows binary).
- **dijkstra_algorithm**: Shortest path finding with Dijkstra’s algorithm.
- **directed_graph**: Operations and visualizations for directed graphs.
- **floyd_warshall_algorithm**: All-pairs shortest path using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
- **kruskal_algorithm**: Minimum spanning tree via Kruskal’s algorithm.
- **optimal_binary_search_tree**: Construction/analysis of optimal BSTs.
- **prim_algorithm**: Minimum spanning tree using Prim’s algorithm.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:
- Provide hands-on demos for key algorithms and data structures.
- Support DSA course instruction at NCNU.
- Offer C++/Qt examples for visualization and experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**
- **Qt framework**
